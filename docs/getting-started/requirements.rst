Requirements
============

You need PHP version 7.1 or higher to add this library to your project.

And ``guzzlehttp/guzzle:^7.X`` is a pear dependency of this library and it requires PHP 7.2 or higher. This pear
dependency is mandatory only if you are using the builtin default HTTP client. Also you can use your own HTTP clients.
See :doc:`Using custom HTTP clients<../usage/customclients>`.
